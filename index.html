                            According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), car accidents are one of 
                            the leading causes of death in the U.S., causing around thirty-five thousand of deaths per year. <br /><br />
                            
                            To understand the cause of car accidents, it is important to understand both demographic 
                            information about drivers, and external factors such as weather, that may contribute to accidents.   <br /><br />
                            
                            This project aims to visually show demographic information of people involved in car accidents in Chicago,  
                            such as age and sex.<br /><br />

                            In addition, this project will visually depict other external factors such as weather, day of the week 
                            and time of day.<br/><br/>

                            With this information, policymakers would have a clear way to visualize the characteristics of accidents and then
                            the use the information gleaned from these visualizations to drive public policy. For example, if the visualizations 
                            show a marked increase in accidents during particular types of weather, policymakers could undertake educational 
                            campaigns to warn drivers about the risks in driving in such weather.   
                            <br /><br />

                            The chart presented on the left side revels something suprinsing, 
                            the higher the GDP of a country is the less likely it is to spend on 
                            education. <br />

                            For instance, if we compare The United States with Turkey, we can see
                            that even though the US has a larger GDP (billions of USD), the education
                            spending represents around 5 percent of the GDP. <br />

                            On the other hand, Turkey with a relatively small GDP compare with
                            The United States of America has an education spending around 12 percent.<br/>

                            That shows that Turkey between the years 2013 and 2018 invested much more 
                            in Education than the other countries in the G20 Group with more GDP.<br/>

                                    This chart shows that most G20 countries spend similar amounts on the healthcare as a portion of GDP.
                                    curiously, those countries located in the European region fromm 2013 to 2018 have remained constant 
                                    in their healthcare spending. Although the United States does not have a higher spending in Education,
                                    it has around 16 percent of spending in healthcare.<br/><br/>

                                    Particularly, China, India and most of the Asia region had had and spending in healtcare of 4 percentage

                            This chart shows that most G20 countries spend similar amounts on the military as a portion of GDP.
                            Interestingly, there are a few outliers.  Notably, the United States devotes a much larger percentage of
                            its GDP to the military than other G20 countries, while China spends a comparatively low amount on its military.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The data in this chart was relatively consistent in the years shown, indicating that the ratio of Military
                            spending to GDP is fairly inelastic.

                                The chart shows that the education spending related to military spending.
                                In most cases education expenditures have been higher than military expenditures with 
                                the exception of two countries: China and Japan. <br/><br/>

                                China has been exponentially increasing its expenditures in military. On the other hand, we 
                                observe that at some point Japan increased its spending in education but later on this spending dropped.
                                This same case can be observed for Turkey.

                            Although there are some increases in military expenditures given for China and the United States, 
                            it is observed in the chart that the spending in military has been lower in comparison with healthcare.

                            <br/><br/>

                            We also can see some spikes in healthcare expenditures for countries such as China, France, Germany, Japan and the United States.
                            Remarkable, The U.S. has been the biggest spender in healthcare and Argentina the lowest. According to the
                            data from 2000 to 2018.

                            per capita is significative lower in comparison to the GDP per capita. Also, It can be 
                            observed that the expenditures in education per person have remained steadily during the

                            It can be observed in the chart that the healthcare expenditures for some countries are higher than from others.
                            For instance, the United States of America had the highest spending in healthcare in comparison with the other G20 countries.
                            <br/><br/>
                            On the other hand, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and China had the lowest expenditures in healthcare. Surprising,
                            there are other countries like India and Indonesia without any expenditure in healtcare for the year 2018. However, the 
                            India's and Indonesia's contries for the same period had GDP per capita relatively low in comparison to the other G20 countries.

                            The chart shows that for the year 2018, some countries did not have any military expenditures.Among them 
                            are Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey. Some of the other countries remain the same in the military spending.
                            For instance, the United States of America and Saudi Arabia. Although, these two contries (the U.S and Saudi Arabia) are
                            signficantlly different in regards to the GDP per capita, both had similar military expenditures.
